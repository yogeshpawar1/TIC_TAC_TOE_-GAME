🎮 How the Game Works

The game is played on a 3×3 grid.

Player X and Player O take turns.

Each player chooses a cell (by entering a number from 1–9) to place their mark.

The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

If all 9 cells are filled and no one has won, the game ends in a draw.
